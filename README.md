## Usage

### Upload Files

1. Click the "Upload File" button
2. Select one or multiple files (up to 500MB each)
3. Choose visibility:
   - **Public** - File is accessible to anyone with the URL
   - **Private** - File requires authentication to access
4. Click "Upload Files"

### Manage File Visibility

- Click the **globe icon** (üåê) to make a file public
- Click the **lock icon** (üîí) to make a file private
- The button will toggle between states

### Copy Public URL

- For public files, click the **clipboard icon** (üìã) to copy the public URL
- URL is **clean and permanent** (no query parameters, no expiration)
- Example: `https://bucket.region.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/image.jpg`
- A success message will appear confirming the URL was copied
- The URL is automatically copied to your clipboard
- See [PUBLIC_URL_INFO.md](PUBLIC_URL_INFO.md) for details

### Create Folders

1. Click "Create Folder"
2. Enter folder name
3. Click "Create Folder"

### Delete Files/Folders

- Click the **trash icon** next to any file or folder
- Confirm the deletion

## Configuration

### PHP Upload Limits

The `.htaccess` file is pre-configured with the following limits:

- `upload_max_filesize`: 512M
- `post_max_size`: 512M
- `max_execution_time`: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- `max_input_time`: 600 seconds
- `memory_limit`: 512M

If using Nginx, add these to your `php.ini` or `php-fpm` configuration.

### S3 Timeouts

The S3 client is configured with:
- Upload timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Connection timeout: 60 seconds (1 minute)

You can modify these in `app/Services/S3Service.php`.

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è "Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded"

This is a PHP configuration issue. **See [PHP_CONFIGURATION.md](PHP_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed solutions.**

**Quick Fix:**
1. Files `.user.ini` and `public/.user.ini` are already created
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to take effect
3. OR restart PHP-FPM: `sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm`
4. If still failing, see PHP_CONFIGURATION.md for your specific server setup

**Verify Settings:**
Create `public/test-limits.php` with this content:
```php
<?php
echo "<pre>";
echo "max_execution_time: " . ini_get('max_execution_time') . " (need: 600)\n";
echo "upload_max_filesize: " . ini_get('upload_max_filesize') . " (need: 512M)\n";
echo "post_max_size: " . ini_get('post_max_size') . " (need: 512M)\n";
echo "memory_limit: " . ini_get('memory_limit') . " (need: 512M)\n";
echo "</pre>";
?>
```
Visit `/test-limits.php` and verify settings. **Delete the file after!**

### Large File Upload Fails

1. Check your PHP configuration limits (see above)
2. Verify your web server timeout settings
3. Ensure your S3 credentials are correct
4. Check S3 bucket permissions
5. Monitor server error logs

### Public URL Not Working

1. Verify file visibility is set to "public"
2. Check S3 bucket CORS settings
3. Ensure bucket has public read permissions enabled
