## 🚀 WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option A: Test Immediately (Recommended)

**The code fixes are active.** Just try uploading now:

1. Go to file manager
2. Click "Upload Files"
3. Select file(s) up to 500MB
4. Upload should work! ✅

### Option B: Apply Server Configuration (If A fails)

Run the automated script:
```bash

```

Or manually restart PHP:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm
```

Or just wait 5-10 minutes for `.user.ini` to apply.

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash

open http://localhost:8000/file-manager

# 2. Try uploading a large file (50-100MB)

# 3. Watch logs for any errors:
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's fixed when:
- ✅ No timeout error
- ✅ Upload completes (even large files)
- ✅ Files appear in the file list
- ✅ Success message shows: "X file(s) uploaded successfully"

## ❌ If Still Getting Error

1. **Restart PHP** (most likely solution):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm
   ```

2. **Check what PHP sees**:
   ```bash
   php -r "set_time_limit(600); echo ini_get('max_execution_time');"
   ```
   Should output: 600 (or 0 for unlimited)

3. **Read detailed guide**:
   - See: `TEST_UPLOAD.md` for troubleshooting

4. **Contact hosting support** if on shared hosting:
   - Ask them to increase `max_execution_time` to 600
